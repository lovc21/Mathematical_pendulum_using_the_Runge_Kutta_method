In this repository, you can finde the code for Homework 4 of the Numerical Methods course.The code is written in Julia, and the main implementation can be found in the file `src/Mathematical_pendulum_using_the_Runge_Kutta_method.jl`. The code is tested using the file `test/runtests.jl`, and it is documented using the file docs/make.jl, you can test the code for the specific by running the `Scripts/script.jl` file.

To run the code, it is necessary to have Julia installed on your computer. Once downloaded, you can run the Scripts/script.jl file to see the results of the code. The results are in a forme of 3 grafs. First graf shows the "Displacement of a Pendulum over Time" the second graf shows the "Displacement of a Harmonic Oscillator over Time" and the last graf shows "Period of a Pendulum as a Function of Energy".

The code is working and the working of the Pendulum is documented using Documenter.jl. To see the documentation, you can run the `docs/make.jl` file. The documentation is also available online at [documentation](https://lovc21.github.io/Mathematical_pendulum_using_the_Runge_Kutta_method.jl/dev/).

TLDR the documntacion. 
Here are the results of the code:
