In this repository, you can finde the code for Homework 4 of the Numerical Methods course.The code is written in Julia, and the main implementation can be found in the file `src/Mathematical_pendulum_using_the_Runge_Kutta_method.jl`. The code is tested using the file `test/runtests.jl`, and it is documented using the file docs/make.jl, you can test the code for the specific by running the `Scripts/script.jl` file.

To run the code, it is necessary to have Julia installed on your computer. Once downloaded, you can run
